# AYJ Graduate Information System

## Overview

The AYJ Graduate Information System is a database that provides helpful information to Grade 12 students who are looking to apply for university. This database contains:

* Information about various undergraduate programs offered by Ontario universities. Students can search for programs by university, program name, OUAC code, major, or admission average. For each program, the database provides the program overview, enrollment cap, contact information, admission requirements, and expected admission average (based on averages of past AY students).

* A question & answer forum where students can submit any questions they may have about the university admission process. When a question is answered by an Admin, it is saved to the database, where it can be viewed by all students.

* Information about past AY Jackson graduates, including their names, student numbers, Grade 12 courses, top six averages, and the university programs to which they got accepted. (To protect the students' privacy, this information is only accessible by Admin users.)
